Bidshire Landing Page
=====================

üéØ Project Overview
-------------------

This repository contains the front-end code for the official **Bidshire** landing page. The goal of this site is to introduce potential clients (primarily construction and service firms bidding on public works) to our software solution and convert visitors into demo requests.

Bidshire's core value proposition is **"We Don't Replace Your Estimator. We Back Them Up."** We provide estimators with the critical competitive intelligence and verifiable data security needed to bid with confidence on government contracts.

üí° What Bidshire Does
---------------------

Bidshire provides a comprehensive platform for managing and analyzing competitive bidding processes for public works projects (RFPs, RFQs).

Core Focus

Automatically archives and secures all documentation, assumptions, and critical calculation data related to every bid, ensuring regulatory compliance and easy retrieval for dispute resolution.

**Risk Reduction**

Replaces guesswork with audited, verifiable data, allowing firms to increase their win rate while minimizing financial risk on complex public contracts.
