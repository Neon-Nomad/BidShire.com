Bidshire Landing Page
🎯 Project Overview
This repository contains the front-end code for the official Bidshire landing page. The goal of this site is to introduce potential clients (primarily construction and service firms bidding on public works) to our software solution and convert visitors into demo requests.

Bidshire's core value proposition is "We Don't Replace Your Estimator. We Back Them Up." We provide estimators with the critical competitive intelligence and verifiable data security needed to bid with confidence on government contracts.

💡 What Bidshire Does
Bidshire provides a comprehensive platform for managing and analyzing competitive bidding processes for public works projects (RFPs, RFQs).

Core Focus

Description

Competitive Intelligence

Provides historical pricing data, competitor analysis, and market averages to help estimators find the optimal bid price point.

Automatically archives and secures all calculation data, assumptions, and critical calculation data related to every bid, ensuring regulatory compliance and easy retrieval for dispute resolution.

Risk Reduction

Replaces guesswork with audited, verifiable data, allowing firms to increase their win rate while minimizing financial risk on complex public contracts.
